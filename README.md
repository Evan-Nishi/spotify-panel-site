# Spotify Panel Site

This is the site that (once self hosted) allows the user to obtain dotenv with the refresh and auth tokens required to interface with the adafruit 64x32 matrix using the spotify api.  Due to the auth flow requiring the usage of the spotify widget, this is unfortunately the only feasible way to obtain a refresh token in a dotenv with the correct permissions.
